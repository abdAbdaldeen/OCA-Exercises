        PS5 and Xbox Series X: Why you shouldn't go next-gen until 2021

        <p>Commentary: November is going to be an exciting month for gaming, but that doesn't mean you should drop hundreds on a new console just yet.</p>

    Final Fantasy 16. God of War: Ragnarok. Halo Infinite. These games have two things in common. 

One, they're all console exclusives. You'll need a PlayStation 5 if you want to play the first two, while Halo Infinite is the excuse Microsoft is giving you to buy an Xbox Series S or X. Two, you won't be able to play any of them until at least next year. 

And that means you don't have to buy either a PS5 or a Series X until next year, either.

        <h3>
            PS5 vs Xbox Series X: full comparison
        </h3>

        <p>
            The PlayStation 5 has a few more incentives. Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is exclusive to PS5 and is likely to be fun. Demon's Souls is sure to be spectacular, but it's also a remake. Then there's Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Sackboy: A Big Adventure. These were originally marketed as PS5 exclusives, but they'll also be coming to PS4. Props to Sony for looking after its 100 million-plus PS4 customers, but this does dull the urgency to buy a PS5. 

So it seems like both companies' selling point isn't the games you can play on next-gen consoles, but the fact that certain games will look better on next-gen consoles.
